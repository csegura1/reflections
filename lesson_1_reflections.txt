The diff command allowed me to see the error and
typo fairly quickly. It organized the changes and
provided an easy viewing experience of all file
updates.

Being able to have access to the entire histoy of
a file can provide working versions of those files
which allow for developing on such files less worry
some since you can always revert back to a working
version.
Also you can be able to view the current developments
of a file as they are occuring.

Being able to manually commit in git hub allows for
full control of deciding the paticular aspects of
changes you would like to commit. Rather than having
a automated system which may commit too often or not
as frequent.

Being able to save multiple files at once in one commit
allows for saving changes that affect files that are
co-dependent of one another. Having git provide such
feature removes the work that is required to perform
such task as checking each individual file.

You can use the git log to view the history of any
changes that were done to the files. Once you are viewing
the changes you are able to use the git diff to compare
that various commits to view the changes between commits.

Being able to revert back to a pervious version allow one
to do make any changes desired regardless if the changes
may break the program.
