When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally when your working
on a project with other individuals or if your working on a project which perhaps you would want to
showcase or have access from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-
date with your remote repository?

If multiple people are adding or removing content from a project, than you would want to have every-
one's changes be updating to your own local version of the project. If done maually, you are able
to filter there the content you want to go ahead and pull from the remote to then be added to your
local version.
