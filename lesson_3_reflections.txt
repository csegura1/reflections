When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally when your working
on a project with other individuals or if your working on a project which perhaps you would want to
showcase or have access from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-
date with your remote repository?

If multiple people are adding or removing content from a project, than you would want to have every-
one's changes be updating to your own local version of the project. If done maually, you are able
to filter there the content you want to go ahead and pull from the remote to then be added to your
local version.

Describe the difference between forks, clone, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones made in github, clones are copies of respositories in the local machine, and branches are adding features to existing respositories.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This allows for accessing and viewing commits done on github from a local machine without the need of being online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier and what would be harder?

You would have to exchange files or respositories to be able to collaborate the way
you would on GitHub or Git. Adding features to a program would require much more
oversight before adding it to the working version of the program.
