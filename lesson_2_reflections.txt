What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git directory is created with the necessary files for a repository.
You need to do this because you need a location to save meta data when committing. This location is within the .git directory. Also this will have the systems recognize the folder as a repository rather than a directory.

How is thee staging area different from the working directory and the respository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is merly a loaction of all the files that can potentially be committed, where as a respository stores the history of commits done on files.
I believe that is provides a opportunity to decide what files to incorpoarte into a specific commit.
