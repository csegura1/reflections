What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git directory is created with the necessary files for a repository.
You need to do this because you need a location to save meta data when committing. This location is within the .git directory. Also this will have the systems recognize the folder as a repository rather than a directory.

How is thee staging area different from the working directory and the respository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is merly a loaction of all the files that can potentially be committed, where as a respository stores the history of commits done on files.
I believe that it provides a opportunity to decide what files to incorpoarte into a specific commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can compare the changes being done to the files in the staging area to the files in the repository, if what is being changed in the files seem like one logical change then you can go ahead and commit the changes.
